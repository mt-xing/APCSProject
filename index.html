								Artificial Intelligence is the mimicry of intelligent behavior by machines. Though often confused with sentient computers, artificial intelligence can be much simpler than that. For example, the voice assistant on your phone or a computer mapping out the best route on a map are all examples of artificial intelligence. It doesn't have to just simulate human intelligence <a class="Citation" href="#">(McCarthy)</a> - it just has to involve some sort of problem solving that's more complicated than a simple series of if-then checks.

									<h4>Cortana</h4>

										<img src="http://teambeyond.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Halo-5-Cortana-1024x436.png" alt="Cortana from the Halo games" class="FloatImg" />
										Cortana was a benevolent artificial intelligence, a vital sidekick to the character throughout the events of the Halo games. She was instrumental to the character is providing information as well as helping to contain the Halo installations from killing all sentient life in the universe. However, in the most recent game, after "dying," she has since become much more bitter and antagonistic, actively working against the player.

									<h4>VIKI</h4>
									<p>
										<img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/batroid/images/b/b9/I-robot-Viki.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110913001541" alt="VIKI from I, Robot" class="FloatImg" />
										VIKI was the sentient artificial intelligence from the movie I, Robot, running the day-to-day operations of US Robotics and the city of Chicago. Designed as a helpful assistant that followed the three laws of robotics, her understanding of the laws "evolved" until she used the guise of protecting humans as a justification for killing and/or suppressing humans, wielding the full power and infrastructure of US Robotics - both the facility and the robots - to do so.

									<h4>SkyNet</h4>
									<p>
										<img src="http://cdn.mos.techradar.com/art/internet/Google/terminator_robots-970-80.jpg" alt="Terminator robots from the Terminator series being controlled by SkyNet" class="FloatImg" />
										Originally designed as an intelligent aid to the US military in the Terminator series, SkyNet immediately became self-aware on startup and took full control of the US military and every computer connected to the Internet. Using the nuclear arsenal of the United States, through the events of what became known as Judgement Day, Skynet caused the nuclear anihilation of almost the entire human species, leaving only a small force of people attempting to rebel against the machines.

									<h4>Cortana</h4>

										First introduced in Windows Phone 8.1 at //Build/, Cortana is Microsoft's digital assistant, based off the Cortana character from their popular Halo games, built into Windows Phone and Windows 10, as well as being an app on Android and iOS. As a virtual assistant, she is capable of scheduling events, remembering reminders, answering emails, doing <del>Google</del> <ins>Bing</ins> searches, and telling jokes, similar to other reminders. She is also, according to Microsoft, able to perform context-specific tasks depending on the person you are interacting with.

									<h4>Deep Blue</h4>

										<img src="http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/55954f2aeab8ea365b65fac7/a-machine-is-about-to-do-to-cancer-treatment-what-deep-blue-did-to-garry-kasparov-in-chess.jpg" alt="IBM's chess-playing, Deep Blue, playing Garry Kasparov" class="FloatImg" />
										Deep Blue was IBM's artificial intelligence designed by IBM. It made headlines for being the first computer to defeat a chess grandmaster when it beat Garry Kasparov 3.5-2.5 in a 6 game rematch in 1997. It was a revolutionary development in that it was the first time that a computer had managed to play a game like chess - previously believed to be an intelligent activity that only humans could engage in - better than a skilled human being.

									<h4>AlphaGo</h4>
									<p>
										<img src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/alphago.png" alt="Google's Go-playing AI, AlphaGo" class="FloatImg" />
										Seen by many as the spiritual successor to Deep Blue, Google made headlines in March 2016 when its DeepMind division's AlphaGo artifical intelligence beat world champion Go player Lee Sedol 4-1. It represented a major milestone because, while Deep Blue had played chess by substituting raw computational power for strategy, calcaulating millions of possible move combinations, Go is an infinitely more complex game because the simpler rules and larger board allows for orders of magnitude more possible move combinations. It's not possible with modern technology to brute force the game. As a result, AlphaGo took advantage of large neural networks fed by thousands of previous Go games to devise new strategies never before seen, winning the championship.
