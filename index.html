									<p>Hello. My name is Michael Xing. I like programming, I guess, because I kind of wasted a metric ton of time I should've spent studying building this custom website. The irony of the whole thing is that I built this myself because I didn't like the default templates Google had laid out in their Google Sites, so I instead went out on my own and used the design template called <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design</a>, invented by... Google. Welp. That happened.</p>
									<p>So yeah. I'm usually very logical, but sometimes I do not logical things simply because I feel like it. Because I'm stubborn. Anyways, this is a website. Enjoy. I spent <span style="font-size:50%;">way too much</span> time on it.</p>

								Artificial Intelligence is the mimicry of intelligent behavior by machines. Though often confused with sentient computers, artificial intelligence can be much simpler than that. For example, the voice assistant on your phone or a computer mapping out the best route on a map are all examples of artificial intelligence. It doesn't have to just simulate human intelligence <a class="Citation" onclick="showPiece('cite-2-4');" href="#cite-2-4">(McCarthy)</a> - it just has to involve some sort of problem solving that's more complicated than a simple series of if-then checks.

Designed as a helpful assistant that followed the three laws of robotics, her understanding of the laws "evolved" until she used the guise of protecting humans as a justification for killing and/or suppressing humans, wielding the full power and infrastructure of US Robotics - both the facility and the robots - to do so <a class="Citation" onclick="showPiece('cite-2-3');" href="#cite-2-3">(IMDB)</a>.

Using the nuclear arsenal of the United States, through the events of what became known as Judgement Day, Skynet caused the nuclear anihilation of almost the entire human species, leaving only a small force of people attempting to rebel against the machines <a class="Citation" onclick="showPiece('cite-2-2');" href="#cite-2-2">(Ford)</a>.

										In the book and film 2001, A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 is an artificial intelligence built into the ship and is considered a vital member of the crew. It performs many necessary tasks to maintain the operational status of the ship and also, from time to time, can participate in other activities like playing chess with the crew. However, due to various reasons, when the scientists attempted to disable HAL, in a last ditch attempt at self preservation, HAL killed the crew with methods at his disposal, such as locking them out of the ship ("Open the pod bay doors."

										Deep Blue was IBM's artificial intelligence designed by IBM. It made headlines for being the first computer to defeat a chess grandmaster when it beat Garry Kasparov 3.5-2.5 in a 6 game rematch in 1997. It was a revolutionary development in that it was the first time that a computer had managed to play a game like chess - previously believed to be an intelligent activity that only humans could engage in - better than a skilled human being <a class="Citation" onclick="showPiece('cite-2-5');" href="#cite-2-5">(Mcphee)</a>.

										Seen by many as the spiritual successor to Deep Blue, Google made headlines in March 2016 when its DeepMind division's AlphaGo artifical intelligence beat world champion Go player Lee Sedol 4-1. It represented a major milestone because, while Deep Blue had played chess by substituting raw computational power for strategy, calcaulating millions of possible move combinations, Go is an infinitely more complex game because the simpler rules and larger board allows for orders of magnitude more possible move combinations. It's not possible with modern technology to brute force the game. As a result, AlphaGo took advantage of large neural networks fed by thousands of previous Go games to devise new strategies never before seen, winning the championship <a class="Citation" onclick="showPiece('cite-2-6');" href="#cite-2-6">(Metz)</a>.

								<h2 class="mdl-card__title-text">Greeps</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
								<p>Alien creatures have landed on Earth! They are the Greeps and they like tomatoes. By some incredible stroke of luck, they have landed in an area where piles of tomatoes are found randomly spread out over the otherwise barren land. They have landed with their spaceship and are swarming out to find and collect tomatoes. Help your Greeps collect as many tomatoes as possible and bring them back to their spaceship.</p>
								<p>The challenge in this programming competition will be to program your Greeps so that they find and collect tomatoes as quickly as possible. You will have limited time, and every tomato you manage to bring back to the spaceship scores a point. As part of this contest, you may modify only the Greep class in the scenario. It will then be handed in to the teacher to be run and compared to others.</p>

								<h2 class="mdl-card__title-text">Reflection</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
								<p>This project was a lot harder than I had originally anticipated. At first, I thought I'd be able to program some simple movement logic that ensured the greeps didn't get stuck on walls and that would be it. Turns out, that was decidedly <strong>not</strong> it. Finding tomatoes wasn't hard, for whatever reason. A bit of randomness in terms of turning when a greep hit a wall easily solved that problem. The real difficulty for me was trying to get the greeps back to the ship with tomatoes. I tried having the greeps backing up and then picking a random direction for a bit before returning to pointing straight at the ship, but that only solved small obstacles and didn't seem to really help in terms of complex environments, like the infamous map 3.</p>
								<p>I know the solution I settled on isn't the best, but given the limited time I had and all the other things I needed to be doing, it's good enough. What ends up happening is that the greep backs up, turns 90 degrees in a direction randomly determined but then remembered, moves, turns 90 degrees in the same direction, and tries moving forward again. If it hits a wall again, repeat. If not, reset the randomly determined direction. This essentially manifests itself in a kind of looping behavior where the greep continuously tries to bump its way down a wall until it reaches the end of the wall and is able to continue on its way. It's not perfect, but it works well enough.</p>
								<p>One of the things I tried that did actually work really well is the paint system I came up with. What basically happens is that anytime a greep is carrying a tomato, it sprays red paint. This essentially means that it'll draw the line it takes from a tomato stash to the ship, which other greeps can follow. Given my pathfinding algorithm, it's not really that useful for meandering routes, but for straight shots to the ship, it's amazingly effective. Coupled with a quick line of code that makes greeps turn 180 degrees after dropping off tomatoes, this ensures that, if a stash of tomatoes is directly facing the ship, within seconds of the first greep discovering it, the entire stash can be efficiently collected. That was actually really easy and really effective to implement.</p>
								<p>Looking at some of the other solutions, I realize that mine isn't particularly impressive nor successful. If I had more time, I'd love to try to figure out a way to better hug walls on the way back to the ship so that my greeps don't get caught while looping, which seems to happen from time to time. However, the fact remains that my program <em>works</em>, and I stand by that.</p>
